First press chooses 4 windows that have been active the last, tiles them so that one window takes the left most half of the screen and other three align on the right side. Next press maximises last used winow. Consecutive presses repeat this process. 


## TODO

Align windows to grid when dragged to certain drop areas.


## WARNING

책 or awithdot is not designed to be ready made application. What it is, is a base for everyone to build what ever utils they need for their window tiling needs.  

책 or awithdot requires access to macOS accessibility. This effectively makes this application also a keylogger. Always review code if you are running 3rd party applications based on this repo.
