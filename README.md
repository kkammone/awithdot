# 책 or awithdot or is simple tiling window manager utility for macOS

## Getting Started

Finnish keyboard layout has one letter that is not natively used in Finnish language, '책'. This small application leverages that and tiles windows when this particular key is pressed.  

First press chooses 4 most recently active windows and tiles them so that most recent window takes the left half of the screen and other three align on the right side. Next press maximises the most recent window. Consecutive presses repeat this process. 

Aligning to grid is also supported, top right or left will align window to that side of screen with 50% width and 100% height

## WARNING

책 or awithdot is not designed to be ready made application. What it is, is a base for everyone to build what ever utils they need for their window tiling needs.  

책 or awithdot requires access to macOS accessibility. This effectively makes this application keylogger. Always review code if you are running 3rd party applications based on this repo or use accessibility in general for that matter.
